# Impact of SMS Reminders on No-Shows

## Overview
This project seeks to answer the research question: Does sending SMS appointment reminders to patients reduce the number of no-show appointments? Using a dataset from over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, the analysis explores if SMS reminders are an effective tool in reducing no-shows, which cost healthcare providers valuable resources and revenue.

## Data
The dataset for this project comes from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments">Kaggle Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset</a> and includes patient demographics, appointment details, and information on whether or not patients received an SMS reminder and subsequently showed up for their appointments.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project was executed and documented using a Jupyter notebook.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: To build and evaluate a logistic regression model.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: Handling real-world, raw data by cleaning, transforming, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed EDA to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables. Used tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for visualizations, including correlation matrices, histograms, and boxplots.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted hypothesis testing using a Chi-Square Test to determine the statistical significance of SMS reminders on no-show rates.
- **Machine Learning**: Built and trained a logistic regression model to predict patient no-shows, a binary classification task. Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**: Assessed the model's performance through confusion matrices and various performance metrics. Analyzed the modelâ€™s predictions to understand where it succeeded and where improvements could be made, specifically in reducing false positives.
- **Data Visualization**: Created meaningful and insightful visualizations to communicate findings, such as the correlation matrix and confusion matrix, using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Results
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: No strong correlations were found between no-shows and patient demographics, though receiving an SMS was related to improved attendance.
- **Chi-Square Test**: The test confirmed a statistically significant relationship between receiving an SMS reminder and reducing no-shows. However, due to the large sample size, this significance should be considered in conjunction with model performance and EDA findings.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: The model performed moderately well, achieving an overall accuracy of 65%. It was more effective at predicting attended appointments than no-shows, suggesting potential for further optimization. With more time, this model's performance could be improved.
